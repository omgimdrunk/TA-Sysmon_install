# TA-Sysmon-Install

This is a Splunk Technology addon that will allow you to install sysmon via a splunk scriptied input to get sysmon data into splunk.

You will need to use the Sysmon TA written by Dave Herald to actually collect the sysmon data (https://github.com/splunk/TA-microsoft-sysmon)

The configuration for sysmon pushed by this will ignore tracking connections for ParentImage splunkd.exe


# Sysmon Threat Intelligence Configuration #

This is a Microsoft Sysinternals Sysmon configuration file template with default high-quality event tracing.

This version is forked from @swiftonsecurity's masterful version with additions to avoid an infinite logging loop when running the Splunk universal forwarder, Splunk heavy forwarder, or full Splunk instance on a system being monitored by sysmon.

The file provided should function as a great starting point for system monitoring in a self-contained package. This configuration and results should give you a good idea of what's possible for Sysmon.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**[sysmonconfig-export.xml](https://github.com/f8al/sysmon-config/blob/master/sysmonconfig-export.xml)**

Because virtually every line is commented and sections are marked with explanations, it should also function as a tutorial for Sysmon and a guide to critical monitoring areas in Windows systems. It demonstrates a lot of what I wish I knew when I began with Sysmon in 2014.

Pull requests and issue tickets are welcome, and new additions will be credited in-line or on Git.

Note: Exact syntax and filtering choices are deliberate to catch appropriate entries and to have as little performance impact as possible. Sysmon's filtering abilities are different than the built-in Windows auditing features, so often a different approach is taken than the normal static listing of every possible important area.

This now has an Auto Updater script to update to the latest Sysmon config hourly.  This is great for mass deployments without having to manually update thousands of systems.
